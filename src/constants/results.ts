They are fairly formal by nature, and want to make sure that any systems that have been implemented, or roadmaps that have been outlined, are adhered to.

You can rest assured that the Supervisor personality will take that into account on their to do-list or roadmap, and that it is addressed in expeditious fashion.

With a collaborative nature that means they work well with other employees, the Improvisor also brings to the table a creativity level that helps them to engineer their way through challenges and dilemmas. \n They do have a preference for casual office cultures that allow for their creativity to shine through rather than their attire (you may be more likely to find them in jeans & a t-shirt than a suit & tie) however they have an instinctive nature that relies on improvisational reactions more-so than task-oriented graft. The Improvisor also displays comfort in dealing with the forward facing ends of the business, such as dealing with clients or promoting the brand concept and identity."

      "This candidate profile can be a one person show from a conceptual, marketing, or product standpoint, however they do have a preference to be left to their own devices when working. This sense of individual work ethic, however, can be an asset to any organization if they deliver on their objectives. \n To achieve this, this candidate prefers an office culture that allows for a casual nature open to creative expression. They also prefer not to be bound by strict guidelines or micromanaged, but rather left to improvise their way past obstacles in the pursuit of making a concept a reality. Despite their independent nature, this type of candidate displays a tendency to gravitate towards the client / customer end of the business, rather than remaining in back office operations. With that being said, they are more that willing to put in the work in the background in their own time, in order to allow them to bring their concept or product out to the public."

      "This type of candidate could be summed up in a nutshell as an “unsung hero” of an organization. They have a tendency to be much more independent, preferring to be left to their own devices in their work rather than reliant upon feedback from a group or colleagues, however they have a creative and improvisational nature that warrants their desire to be granted space. \n They gravitate towards back office operations, without much desire for limelight or recognition, and are happy to deal with troublesome obstacles or tasks for the sake of keeping the organization moving forward. This particular candidate profile displays a preference for a casual & creative office culture, rather than a formal corporate culture."

Independent by nature, they prefer being assigned a task, and then being left to their own devices to complete it. They also gravitate towards creative solutions and innovative methods when faced with a new challenge or particularly tricky obstacle. \n They certainly prefer to let their work do the talking, and can often be less concerned with personal appearance and presentation than they are with the outcome and efficiency of their work.

      "This is a candidate who likes to be in the room when an idea, strategy, or product is dreamt up, have a direct hand in bringing it to market & then deliver it to the public themselves. The Team Rep candidate persona is one that is a team player, who loves to collaborate with other member of their organization to bring a project to life. \n Once an idea is thought up, this type of candidate likes to break down in detail what they need to do to achieve the objective at hand, and stick to their roadmap precisely once this has been identified.

      "The Strategist is a keen and insightful type of candidate, and one that can often be relied upon to look out for the long term interests of your organization. Independent by nature, these types of candidates are not always swayed by “group-think” mentality, and will often be the employee in your organization playing devil’s advocate or pondering alternatives. \n They are formal & professional, and also have a knack for improvising their approach or strategy to get a project finished as new information comes to light. They tend to gravitate to life behind the scenes, rather than the client or customer facing end of a business, and like to make sure that things are structured and running properly under the hood of your organization. When channeled properly, this is one type of client whose opinion and input can be quite valuable to an organization, as they have a tendency to look further down the road than the immediate things that come across their desk."

      "This type of candidate gets the creative juices and sparks flowing when your team is in the brain-storming stage. They would rather work with a team than in isolation any day of the week, and the creativity and casual nature help get things flowing when it’s time for the group to put their heads together. \n You can definitely think more of these types of candidates as the idea people rather than executors, and they have a far greater tendency to improvise along the way of a project than to stick to a rigid roadmap or set of instructions. That’s not to say that they can’t push a project along as effectively as anyone, however, as their gift tends to lie in seeing their way around the next obstacle rather than getting tunnel vision, and instructing the team when they believe its the right time to pivot. This type of candidate works best when they have other employees around them to do the hard graft & legwork, while they cultivate ideas and direct the team accordingly throughout a project. These types of employees prefer to be a valuable contributor to a project behind the scenes, and prefer being a mind in the office rather than being a face on the front lines."

They are independent by nature, and prefer to get their hands on a task and see it through themselves without relying on others or feedback from a group of peers. \n They are formal and professional, preferring the atmosphere and culture of a professional and legitimate organization that they feel matches their own ability and ambition. They are comfortable with both the back office aspects of their job, as well as the interactional client facing side of business as well. They are comfortable with meeting and speaking with clients or customers themselves, or promoting a product or service, because they know that they have delivered quality work and are therefore capable of representing themselves and the company in a positive light."

These types of candidates slot right in to the operations department of a professional office culture, and can ultimately be well suited for a career trajectory towards Director of Operations, such is the value of their input and guidance behind the scenes. \n They love being part of a team and collaborating, and have a flexible mindset when it comes to improvising as a project unfolds. They are happy being in the background, so long as their thoughts are heard and, while not always accepted by their peers, are at respected. They tend to be frustrated when they do not have direct input or their ideas are not received seriously, which is why this is a candidate who tends to bring valuable perspective and vision to the table."

    description:
      "This type of candidate places most of their focus on making sure the final presentation of a product, service or project is stellar, and for this reason tend to be fairly meticulous along the way. They do tend to be independent, but if it’s necessary for them to work with a team to get a job done, they will expect the best out of those around them so as not to wind up with a disappointing end result. \n The reason for this, is that that Presenter personality type loves to bring the end-product to market themselves, and want to make sure they are offering only the best. They feel embarrassed if what they are offering to the public is anything less, which explains their tendency towards perfectionism. Behind the scenes, this is the type of employee who will be plugging away at a project for weeks on end, not caring if it looks like they’ve let their personal attire or presentation fall by the wayside in the meantime, so long as their work is speaking for itself. This changes when in the public eye however, as this type of candidate will like to have everything prepared for a glowing presentation once it’s time to unveil or sell something, and their own presentation is usually as glowing as the product itself."

      "This type of candidate is the glue that holds your team together while working on a project. They love to collaborate on a team, and would rather pick a position where this is the case rather than working in isolation. They have a creative and casual nature that others tend to gravitate to and feed off, and will typically come across as more inspiring and less threatening to colleagues around them. \n The beauty of this type of candidate is that they’ll not only tend to have a hand in coming up with an idea, but once its conceptualized, they have a tendency to hit the drawing board quickly and map out detailed steps that need to be taken, often doing most of this work themselves and making their colleagues around them look good in the process. This type of candidate contributes amply behind the scenes, but is content with being in the back office making the magic happen rather than out on the front lines receiving the credit or representing the company. Instead, this is the reliable member of the team who holds things together behind the scenes."

    description:
      "This type of candidate could be classified as a born leader, and most times their independent yet highly professional demeanor makes them an example to those around them and positive representation of an organization. The Team Executive is independent by nature, and is the type of employee that loves coming to work dressed as sharp as they intend to perform everyday. \n They like to tackle challenges as they prevent themselves, and tend to be much more improvisational than they are task oriented. This can be great in management positions, as they work best when they have somebody behind them to do the administrative work while they are left to deal with any unforeseen tasks, challenges or obstacles. The icing on the cake with this employee is that they love the client / customer side of the business, making them a great representative or salesperson for an organization as well. They know how to adapt and identify with a client, and are confident and comfortable in their ability to do so. Don’t expect to lock this type of candidate in a back office and suppress them, as they will want to be out on the front lines driving up your bottom line, and in most cases you will be glad that you allowed them to."
